### Dataset Description

The data consists of six sub datasets which describes the data with a brief information.

The files that have been used for this practice are:

- Business Dataset (139 MB)

### Problem Statement

Thus, this project aims to train a model, that given a set of keywords based on the review of the users, in order to predict the rating of a review. To do so, we will implement NLP and kind of sentiment analysis when building the model.
